# Guild
Guild is a general development project with the idea of learning a few things.

- [ ] Java + Gradle development process
- [ ] Docker container creation and management
- [ ] Automated build and deploy process

The biggest thing I am looking to learn is the CD/CI process. Docker was chosen for the 
runtime environment as it can provide an identical env everytime on any system. Github 
actions is used as the pipeline tool just because it is provided by the repo. GitLab and 
other systems could be used, but I liked GitHub's actions market making it easier to 
make build and deploy scripts.

###### Right now this bot does NOTHING. It's basically useless.

## Workflow
I will be trying to subscribe to the GitFlow workflow, but we will see
